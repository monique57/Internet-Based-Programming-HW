HTML Image Syntax The HTML tag is used to embed an image in a web page. 
Images are not technically inserted into a web page;
Images are linked to websites. The tag creates a hold for the referenced image.
The tag is empty, it only contains attributes and has no closing tag. 

The tag has two required attributes: 
src - Specifies the path to the image. 
Alt - Specifies alternative text for the image
